**No.** Whilst any kind of `Functor` representing finite sequences of elements will be `Traversable` (hence `Foldable`), there are plenty of other structures which are `Traversable`, but which aren't sequence-like, in that they don't have an obvious notion of concatenation. There will be a way to obtain the sequence of contained elements, but the structure may consist of more than just that sequence.

What `Traversable f` means, in effect, is that structures with type `f x` contain finitely many elements of type `x`, and that there is some way to `traverse` the structure visiting each element of `x` exactly once. So things like "terms in a syntax, seen as containing variables" can be `Traversable`.

    data Term x
      = Var x
      | Val Integer
      | Add (Term x) (Term x)

    instance Traversable Term where
      traverse f (Var x)    = pure Var <*> f x
      traverse f (Val i)    = pure (Val i)
      traverse f (Add s t)  = pure Add <*> traverse f s <*> traverse f t

You can always use `traverse` to do operations on all elements. We get `fmap` by taking `pure = id` and `<*>` to be ordinary application.

    instance Functor Term where
      fmap = fmapDefault

where

    fmap :: (x -> y) -> Term x -> Term y
    
implements *simultaneous renaming*.

Meanwhile, the `Foldable` instance

    instance Foldable Term where
      foldMap = foldMapDefault

takes `pure` to give the neutral element of some monoid and `<*>` to the combining operation, so we get reduce-like operations. E.g.,

    foldMap (:[]) :: Term x -> [x]

gives the list of variables occurring in a term. That is we can always obtain the sequence of elements from `Traversable` data, but the data might have structure other than those elements. `Term`s have structure other than variables (their `Val`s and `Add`s), and it's not so clear what "cons" means for syntax trees.

So, while more structures than sequences are `Traversable`, the `Traversable` interface offers you fewer sequence-like operations. The point of `Traversable` is to generalize *map*-like and *reduce*-like operations, not to capture *list*-ness.
